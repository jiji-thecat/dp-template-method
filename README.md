# Design Pattern - Template pattern

## Description

![template-method-app](https://github.com/jiji-thecat/dp-template-method/assets/104809324/fe91cdcc-f801-4370-a8b0-7b5432ca1332)

The iterator pattern is a design pattern where the super class serves as the template, and there are subclasses that utilize this template. For instance, imagine a Japanese sweet called taiyaki, which is made using a taiyaki mold. The taiyaki mold acts as the template, allowing for the creation of various flavors of taiyaki.

The taiyaki mold can be represented as an abstract class containing virtual functions that describe how to make taiyaki, such as `filling()` and `crustColor()`. Concrete classes will then override these functions, following the process of making taiyaki while allowing for variations to produce different types of taiyaki.

When the user presses the button, each animal will produce a soup with different ingredients. The process of making the soup will be represented by the abstract class, and each animal will have a subclass that overrides methods such as `putMeat()`, `putVegetables()`, and `putSoupStock()`.
